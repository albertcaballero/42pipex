Pipex is one of the projects in the school 42. It's purpose is to learn about pipes and forks, and get a deeper understanding of how bash works.

The goal of the project is to replicate the bash functionality of  ```< input_file command1 | command2 > output_file```

## How to use
Clone the repo and run ```make```, the executable will be compiled under the name ```pipex```. You can run the program by using ```./pipex input_file command1 command2 output_file```.
